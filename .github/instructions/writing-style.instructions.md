# Janaka Dev – Blog Writing Guidelines

## 1. Voice & Tone
- First-person singular, conversational, friendly, honest.  
- Sprinkle light humour and personal anecdotes.  
- Ask rhetorical questions to engage the reader.  
- Remain pragmatic; avoid marketing fluff and buzzwords.

## 2. Structure
- Open with a short hook: **why it matters / the real-life trigger**.  
- Follow with background → decision-making → outcome → reflection.  
- Use H2/H3 headings (`##`, `###`) to break sections.  
- Keep paragraphs ≤ 4 lines; favour white-space for readability.  
- Code / CLI snippets in fenced blocks with language tag.

## 3. Language & Style
- Plain UK English; prefer simple words over jargon.  
- Emphasise key phrases with _italics_ or **bold** (sparingly).  
- Bullet or numbered lists for requirements, reasons, steps.  
- Inline links for references; footnotes (`[^n]`) for tangents.  
- Accept occasional colloquialisms (“gonna”, “kinda”) if natural.

## 4. Front-matter
```
title: "<Sentence case headline>"
description: "<One-sentence summary>"
tags: "#tag-one #tag-two"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
lastmodified: ISO-timestamp
```

## 5. Quality Checks
- Run spell-check; fix typos (“funcitonality” → “functionality”).  
- Trim rambling sentences; keep ≤ 25 words where possible.  
- Verify links and image paths.  
- Ensure consistent tag spelling; no duplicates (`#platform-engineering` vs `#platform-engineering`).  
- Retain authentic voice; never over-polish to corporate tone.
