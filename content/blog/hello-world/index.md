This is my first post hosted on [IPFS](ipfs.io), the distributed Internet. How exciting!

I wanted and excuse to play with IPFS and thought putting up a blog on IPFS would be a good little project. It also gives me an excuse to play with static site generators. I've picked Gatsby. I'm starting simple, using the `Gatsby blog starter` and mardown files. In the future I might move to using a headless CMS like [Contentful](https://contentful.com) or [Prismic](https://prismic.io).
