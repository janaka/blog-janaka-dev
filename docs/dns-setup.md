# DNS Setup
Login to Cloudflare to see DNS config.


Note:
- Add HTTPS support: follow instructions here to generate a TLS cert [](https://www.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway/).
The `.dev` TLD is forced to HTTPS. The IPFS public gateway doesn't support TLS for custom domains. But the CloudFlare gateway does (:thanksyou: CloudFlare).
